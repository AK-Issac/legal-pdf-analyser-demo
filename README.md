# **AI Legal Document Analyzer**

Chat with your PDFs using a powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** backend built with **Python, Flask, and LangChain**, and a responsive **React + Vite** frontend using APIs and Storage.
This project transforms how you interact with dense legal documents. Instead of manually searching through pages, you can upload a PDF and ask questions in plain English. The AI reads, locates, and cites relevant sections instantly.
